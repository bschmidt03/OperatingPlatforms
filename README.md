# OperatingPlatforms
Who was the client, and what software did they want?
The client was The Gaming Room, a company looking to expand their game Draw It or Lose It to multiple platforms. They wanted a web-based version of the game that could run seamlessly on desktop operating systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux, as well as on mobile platforms such as iOS and Android.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I thoroughly evaluated each operating platform for its advantages and weaknesses, ensuring that my recommendations aligned with the client’s goals for scalability and cost-effectiveness. I also made sure to communicate my findings clearly and concisely, which helped simplify complex concepts for the client.

What did you find helpful about working through the design document?
The process helped me understand the client’s needs in greater detail and break down the technical requirements into manageable sections. It also ensured that I considered every aspect of the project—such as server hosting, compatibility, and security—before diving into development, resulting in a more organized and focused approach.

What would you revise, and how?
If I could revise one part, I would improve the section on licensing costs by providing more specific and up-to-date estimates. Including examples and links to resources for tools and server options would make the recommendations even more actionable for the client.

How did you interpret and implement the user’s needs?
I identified that the client wanted a scalable and responsive game that could run on a variety of platforms. By focusing on cross-platform compatibility, secure communication between devices, and ease of use, I ensured that the design aligned with their requirements. Considering the user’s needs is crucial to create software that delivers value and provides a smooth experience.

How did you approach designing the software, and what would you do in the future?
I started by breaking the project into sections—server-side hosting, client-side compatibility, storage, and security. This systematic approach ensured all aspects were covered. In the future, I’d incorporate prototyping and more stakeholder feedback early in the design phase to refine ideas and address potential issues sooner.
